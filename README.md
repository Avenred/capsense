# What is Capsense?
  * How did Capsense come into being
        Capsense was originally an idea thought of by [Averend](https://github.com/Avenred) a fellow programmer. Averend came up with a program that would check if caps was on every so often and turn it off, He thought of this because of his troubles with accidently leaving caps on and typing things in all caps on accident.
  * What does it do
        As you might have guessed Capsense simply turns of caps after a certain amount of time has passed, however, capsense comes in the form of a compact tray application (or as a configureable sub-process in the linux distro). This means that it is light-weight, configurable through a menu, and generally un-noticable
  * Why would you need/want it
        Let's face it your probally very lazy (which is probally why your a programmer and on GitHub) I know that if I'm messaging someone 9 times out of 10 I forget to turn off caps-lock because of my brain being lazy. This app fixes your lazyness by making you more lazy.
        
# Installation
In the most recent version the only available platform is windows. It also is not available as a .exe file, so if you want to execute it you will need the most recent version of python and (optionaly) a batch file to run the distro. The only required files are located in /capscontrol/capsense you can copy all of those files into a folder of your choice. 
# If you choose to make a batch file: 
Place the command "python main.py" into the batch file
# Otherwise...
Just run it whenever you want I guess...

# Bam!
You now have a distrobution of Capsense! Congrats!

Fixes to this README will be frequent (especially since my sense of grammar and spelling is horrible) due to errors and updates to the distros
