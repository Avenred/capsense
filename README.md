# What is Capsense?
* Capsense automatically turns off Caps Lock after it's been on for a while. Capsense will not turn off Caps Lock while you are still typing (in caps).
* Capsense works in the background as a tray app, or as a hidden process on Linux. It designed to be lightweight and unnoticeable.
* The idea for capsense was coined by fellow programmer [Avenred](https://github.com/Avenred)

# Installation
On Windows, Capsense can be installed by downloading the .exe from our releases page (to be added). <!-- TODO: Additional instructions for Linux go here. -->

<!--- Fixes to this README will be frequent (especially since my sense of grammar and spelling is horrible) due to errors and updates to the distros --->
